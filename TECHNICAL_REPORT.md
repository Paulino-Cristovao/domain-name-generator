## 1. Technical Architecture

### 1.1 Model Selection & Optimization

We selected 5 language models optimized for M1 Mac with <4GB memory footprint:

| **DistilGPT2** | 82M | ~330MB | Fastest inference |

### 1.2 M1 Hardware Optimizations

**MPS Acceleration**: All models use Metal Performance Shaders for GPU acceleration
- Average 2.5x speedup over CPU
- bfloat16 precision for Llama/Phi models
- Memory-efficient batch sizes with gradient accumulation

**Configuration Details:**
```python
# M1-specific optimizations
device = "mps"  # Metal Performance Shaders
torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16  # For Llama/Phi
model_kwargs = {
    "low_cpu_mem_usage": True,
    "device_map": None,  # Manual MPS placement
    "torch_dtype": torch.bfloat16
}
```

### 1.3 Training Configuration

**Unified Training Setup:**
- **Epochs**: 2 (all models)
- **LoRA Fine-tuning**: r=8-16, alpha=16-32
- **Learning Rates**: 1e-4 to 5e-4 (model-dependent)
- **Batch Sizes**: 1-8 (memory-optimized)
- **Gradient Accumulation**: 1-8 steps

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### 2.1 LLM-as-a-Judge with GPT-4o

We implemented a comprehensive evaluation system using GPT-4o as judge with 5 weighted criteria:

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Relevance** | 30% | Business description alignment |
| **Memorability** | 25% | Easy to remember and type |
| **Professionalism** | 20% | Credible and trustworthy |
| **Length** | 15% | Appropriate character count (6-15 chars) |
| **Clarity** | 10% | Clear purpose and meaning |

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Generate 5 domain suggestions per business description
2. Submit to GPT-4o judge with structured prompt
3. Receive scores (1-10) for each criterion
4. Calculate weighted overall score
5. Aggregate results across all test cases

### 2.2 Test Case Coverage

**Standard Test Cases (10):**
- AI-powered restaurant management platform

**Edge Cases (5):**
- Very short inputs (\"AI\")
- Very long inputs (>100 characters)
