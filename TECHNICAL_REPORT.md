**M1-Specific Configuration:**
```python
# Optimized for Apple Silicon
device = "mps"  # Metal Performance Shaders
torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16  # Native M1 precision
model_kwargs = {
    "low_cpu_mem_usage": True,
    "device_map": None,  # Manual MPS placement
    "torch_dtype": torch.bfloat16,
    "attn_implementation": "eager"  # Phi-3 compatibility

### 1.5 GPT-4o LLM-as-a-Judge Implementation

We implemented a comprehensive evaluation system using GPT-4o as judge with 5 weighted criteria:

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Generate 5 domain suggestions per business description
2. Submit to GPT-4o judge with structured prompt
3. Receive scores (1-10) for each criterion
4. Calculate weighted overall score
5. Aggregate results across comprehensive test cases

### 1.6 Safety & Guardrail Framework

**Safety Filter Implementation:**
- Content-based filtering with keyword detection
- Context-aware analysis for legitimate business use
- Confidence scoring for borderline cases
- JSON API integration for real-time safety checks

### 1.7 Reproducibility & Version Tracking
